Cyberspace has undoubtedly presented us with new opportunities. Over the last few decades, the rapid growth of the internet, accompanied by new technology and networks, has delivered a society that is arguably more innovative, progressive and dynamic - and one that is constantly evolving. Yet, despite this development and progress into a world of greater technological advancement, interconnectedness, and opportunity – there lies unanticipated risks and inadvertent consequences. This is an issue that has caused governments, organisations, and even the individual, to reorganise and reconsider the question ‘What is cyber security?’ As a result, government policy and society’s overall perspective of cyber security is almost certainly changing. This section will attempt to tease out some of key themes that we are beginning to associate with cyber security.</p><p>

In 2007, the world witnessed its first case of cyber warfare, as Estonia was subjected to an unprecedented cyber attack - ripping through large sectors of its infrastructure and disrupting vast swathes of government, banking and media - with Russia long being suspected, although never attributed. Since this cornerstone moment, we’ve seen the likes of Stuxnet (2010), Flame (2012) and the Sony Pictures attack (2014) offer real instances of states becoming embroiled in acts of ‘war’ - albeit through new and unseen before methods.</p><p>

Despite our own question at hand - ‘What is cyber security?’ - proving to not be as quite straightforward as we believed, it would appear that governments, businesses and cyber policy experts (to name but a few) are also in a struggle to fully understand the implications and mediate against the growing threats posed by the growth in ‘cyber’ across a vast spectrum of society today. </p><p>

Take the UK for example, where cyber security is now considered in a similar ilk to international terrorism, military crises and natural disasters, as a key priority in its own National Security Strategy. Security strategies that were once meticulously designed for use, and implemented in physical spaces, are now having to be considered within new ‘virtual’ spaces – as new fears are heralded of unknown and unidentified attackers.</p><p>

But as threats to infrastructure and the daily lives of citizens (take the recent TalkTalk hacks as a pertinent example) continue to rise at a considerable rate, businesses too now seek to implement their own measures, strategies, and standards, as a means of securing their own vital information and services. The use of standards, within an organization for example, can become a means of reducing the chance of attacks being successful – although, on the contrary, it could be argued that the use of standards may also create further risks and vulnerabilities within any given organization.</p><p>

Hardly a day goes by without news of a new cyber threat, potential attack or data breach, as we have seen an unsettling growth in cyber crime throughout society today. Cyberspace is becoming an incredibly attractive proposition for criminals, activists and terrorist organisations, who see the potential to make money, get noticed, or generally cause havoc as a prime motivator for their actions. We have seen the emergence of the Dark Web - providing an entry point into the furthest recesses of the internet - facilitating the rise of Silk Road and other examples of nefarious activities occurring online. On the flip side however, we have seen increasing efforts by governments and various organisations to attempt to step up their game and tackle the issue of cyber crime more seriously - and arguably still falling short – as we begin to note a huge rise in the number of cyber attacks or data breaches occurring (in the UK especially) on a more regular basis.</p><p>

Finally, it would be pertinent to ask what role does the media play in our understanding and attempts to answer the question: ‘What is cyber security?’? If we were to rewind back to 10 years ago: would a news item related to cyber security make the 10 o’clock headlines? Almost certainly not. Fast-forward to today: TalkTalk and Vodafone’s recent hacks (alongside many other examples around the world) push their own security shortcomings and the customer’s privacy to the top of news agendas and front-pages. Change may be afoot as cyber security becomes the buzzword of journalists, politicians, and – even us – academics. </p><p>

Perhaps we must now consider cyber policy (and all of the aforementioned sectors above) as a vital cog in any governments overall national security strategy? What’s more, the term ‘cyber security’ is beginning to enter the mind-set and households of the everyday citizen – no longer just the security professional, hacker or academic. When specific attacks or breaches begin to effect the privacy and safety of ordinary citizens, the picture – and question at hand – begins to look very different as the general perspective of cyber security begins to alter.
