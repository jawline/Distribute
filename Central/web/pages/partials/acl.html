Access control within an organisation is vital to eliminate risk as it is used to ensure that employees are given the appropriate access in order to perform their role within the business.  There are different types of access control: network access control (NAC), identity management (IDM), Web access control, remote access control, and device or endpoint access control.  In this presentation, particular attention will be given to identity management which ensures that employees are given access to the right corporate resources.</p><p>

It involves three processes: authentication, authorisation and audit.  The authentication process confirms the user’s credentials in order to allow access to resources.  These credentials take the form of the employee’s user name and password or in some organisations it could be a multifactor authentication process such as a smart card and PIN.</p><p>

The second process is authorisation which gives employees access to the appropriate applications, servers, data stores, buildings and equipment.  There are two parts to the process of authorisation: firstly the system needs to identify who the user is and what level of access they have been granted.</p><p>

The third process is auditing which creates a trail of user activities.  This is important for administrators to check that users are not attempting to access resources they are not authorised to or perhaps where a user has mistakenly been granted access to something they shouldn’t.  Another issue that may be raised during the audit process is multiple logins for one user.  This may become apparent if there appears to be inappropriate work output within the system.  Some organisations have a policy that users should not share their user names and passwords with their colleagues.  This may seem quite obvious but there is a lack of education amongst employees about the consequences of such a practice.  In one of the organisations I worked for it was a common occurrence for users, including those in senior positions within the business to share their login credentials with new employees, who were still awaiting their own user name and password.  While it was meant to be a sackable offence to share credentials it was never actually enforced by the access control department or HR.  From this it can be seen how poor implementation of access control can easily put the organisation’s information at risk.
