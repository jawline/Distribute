               Cybercrime is defined as any crime that involves a computer and a network [1] and can be committed by individuals or groups against individuals, organisations or companies. The main motive behind cybercrime is shared with standard crime i.e. monetary gain, however some cases arise in which criminal activities such as DDOS, hacking and online defamation are done for purely social and ethical reasons e.g. Ashley Madison [2]. The main bulk of cyber crime is committed on the `dark web` or what is loosely defined as any internet traffic not visible to the open internet. Organised criminals or users of criminal services gather in groups on what is called `underground markets` which allow for any anonymous users to purchase services or products offered by any other user; usually in exchange for bitcoins as part of an escrow service. Many of the services offered can be seen below in the results of our investigation and include the selling of weapons, drugs and legal highs, fake passports and ID's, prostitution, hacking services, DDOS services (booters), hitmen, hacked PayPal accounts and credit card dumps, counterfeit money, shells to hacked machines, Apple products, hacking tutorials and scams.

               Organised criminals make use of malware infecting other machines in order to steal personal information, banking details or personal data. The main method of spreading malware is through phishing and email scams or browser zero day exploits. Once a machine is infected the adversary may install RATs in order to spy on the individual e.g. turning on the webcam, Adware to deliver custom adverts to the user in order to make financial profit from viewing adverts, Ransomware to encrypt all of the users personal data and force to user to pay for retrieval of such files or install Key logging software to try and steal banking details or online account information.
