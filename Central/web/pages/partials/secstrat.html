describes the UK’s approach to cyber security, developed by the National Cyber Security Programme (NCSP).  The four broad objectives are:

<ul>
<li>“Making the UK one of the most secure places in the world to do business in cyberspace.”  This is being achieved by providing guidance to industry, for example with  “10 step to Cyber Security” produced by the government.  To raise awareness of the need for cyber security every the Information Security Breaches Survey is published every year by the BIS. To promote the sharing of information on cyber security between firms the government launched the Cyber Security Information Sharing Partnership (CISP). The government also aims to incentivise good practise in cyber security, in order to do this Cyber Essentials was launched, which is designed to be affordable and gives the firms certificated a badge to display. The National Cyber Crime Unit has been developed to tackle serious cyber crime, The NCCU also deals with cyber crime on a global level.  The government also aims to improve public awareness on cyber security, for example through Cyber Streetwise, which tries to improve cyber security among the public.</li><li>
“Making the UK more resilient to cyber attack and better able to protect our interests in cyberspace.” The NCSP invests in GCHQ, to investigate the very sophisticated threats to the UK. The government also works with industry to ensure resilience via CERT-UK which works to prepare for the impact of a future cyber security attack.  The government is also improving the cyber security of its own systems, for example now all government departments have included cyber security in their risk management schemes. The government is also improving the cyber security of the armed forces, for example the Cyber Security Model for Defence which will be implemented in 2015. </li><li>
“Helping shape an open, vibrant and stable cyberspace that supports open societies.” Because, cyberspace is not limited by national borders, the government is working towards developing international collaboration, with many other countries. This includes helping to develop the EU cyber security strategy. The government also aims to improve trans border law enforcement for cyber crime, by cooperating with other countries. </li><li>
“Building the UK’s cyber security knowledge, skills and capability” The NCSP aims to ensure the UK has a workforce with skills and in cyber security, this includes developing teaching materials to be used in schools. GCHQ also has an apprenticeship scheme. Cyber security teaching is also being encouraged in higher education, it is now a compulsory subject in all undergraduate courses accredited by the British Computer Society and the Institution of Engineering and Technology. There are now 6 Masters courses accredited by GCHQ in cyber security, as well as 2 centres of doctoral training. The government also aims to develop a community of effective cyber security professionals. </li></ul>
