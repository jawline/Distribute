When asking the question ‘What is cyber security?’, it is worth reflecting on what role the media plays in our overall understanding of the term.
</p><p>
In recent years, a case could be made that there has been a real shift in the media coverage of cyber security. If we are to look back a decade or so ago, the phrase ‘cyber security’ would have very little presence in our newspapers, or on the front pages of news websites. It could be argued that many in the media felt that the public were put off by complicated issues or jargon or they simply were not interested in the subject of cyber security (not that we are arguing that information/cyber security wasn’t as important within this period). However, if we fast-forward to today, the issue of cyber is very much a hot topic of conversation. In just the last week, hacks to TalkTalk and Vodafone have instigated huge media discussion on privacy, the protection of our data, and even the social status/backgrounds of the teenage hackers involved while late last year, the Sony hacks had the press in frantic discussion, prophesizing possible nuclear destruction between the US and North Korea. Has cyber security hit the ‘big time’? It is arguably now part of our public discourse and debate – and not just the concerns of governments, big organisations and information security experts. Driven by strong US rhetoric and supported by a now fully engaged media, it would appear the media have a huge role to play in framing our discussions on cyber security right now, and in the future.</p>
