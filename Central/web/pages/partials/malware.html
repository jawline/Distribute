                <p>Malware is a term used to describe software that intentionally causes harm to subverts the intended function of the system. Classical groups of malware include viruses, worms and Trojan horses although with the increase in the complexity of modern malware, the distinction between these groups is becoming blurred.</p><p>
Computers by their nature are complex machines and are typically built with extensibility in mind. Malicious programmers can modify systems software that is already installed the machine to carry out harmful activities, for example recording key strokes on a key board. This data can then be sold on to criminals in order to carry out fraud and identity theft.</p><p>
Typically, malware is installed on a computer as part of a complicated attack that involves many stages. Malware writers have become technologically savvy by creating malware that not only ‘hides’ in areas that are often not accessed by the user but also incorporate characteristics that make it difficult for security software such as anti-viruses to detect and deal with them. Popular techniques include obfuscating the code in order to prevent initial detection, replicating the code into hard-to-reach areas and changing the code while keeping the same semantics.</p><p>
Even after malware has been discovered, further techniques are used to thwart any kind of analysis of the software by security companies and researchers. This increases the time that the malware can stay active before any mitigations are created.</p><p>
