Cyber security describes the protection of a key legal asset through constitutional means against actor-related, technical, organisational and natural dangers posing a risk to the security of cyber space (including infrastructure and data security) as well as the security of the users in cyber space. Cyber security helps to identify, assess and follow up on threats as well as to strengthen the ability to cope with interferences in or from cyber space, to minimise the effects as well as to restore the capacity to act and functional capabilities of the respective stakeholders, infrastructures and services.</p><p>
